// JavaScript is dynamically typed Language as we don't need to define it's variables datatypes while using.
// 1. Primitive

// # 7 Types :-------> String, Boolean, Number, null, undefined, BigInt, Symbol;

// 2. Non - Primitive or Reference type :------->
// Arrays, Objects, Functions,

// NULL typeof
// The reason why null is an object in JavaScript is because of a historical bug in the language. When JavaScript was first created, values were represented as a type tag and a value. The type tag for objects was 0, and null was also represented as 0. Therefore, null had the same type tag as objects, and typeof null returned “object”. This bug was never fixed for backward compatibility reasons1.

// typeof function is object function.

// Return type of variables in JavaScript
// 1) Primitive Datatypes
//        Number => number
//        String  => string
//        Boolean  => boolean
//        null  => object
//        undefined  =>  undefined
//        Symbol  =>  symbol
//        BigInt  =>  bigint

// 2) Non-primitive Datatypes
//        Arrays  =>  object
//        Function  =>  function
//        Object  =>  object

// Stack(used by all primitive type ) and Heap Memory (used by all non-primitive types)
